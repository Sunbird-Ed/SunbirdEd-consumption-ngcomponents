# Common angular components for Sunbird consumption!
Contains common UI components powered by angular. These components are designed to be used in sunbird consumption platforms *(mobile app, web portal, offline desktop app)* to drive reusability, maintainability hence reducing the redundant development effort significantly. 

# Getting Started
For help getting started with a new Angular app, check out the Angular CLI.
For existing apps, follow these steps to begin using .

## Step 1: Install the package

    npm install @project-sunbird/common-consumption --save
    npm install @project-sunbird/sb-styles --save

## Step 2: Include the sb-styles and assets in angular.json
    "styles": [
    ...
    ...
    "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sb-styles/assets/_styles.scss"
    ]
  Add following under architect.build.assets

     {
	    ...
	    "build": {
	    
	    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
	    
	    "options": {
		    ...
		    ...
    
		    "assets": [
		    
			   ...
			   ...
			    
			    {
				    "glob": "**/*.*",
				    "input": "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/common-consumption/assets",
				    "output": "./assets/common-consumption"
			    }
		    
		    ],
    
	    "styles": [
	    
	    ...
	    
	    "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sb-styles/assets/_styles.scss"
	    
	    ],
	    
	    ...
	    ...
    
    },

  

## Step 3: Import the modules and components
Import the NgModule for each component you want to use:
       
    import { CommonConsumptionModule} from '@project-sunbird/common-consumption';
    
    @NgModule({
	    ...
	    
	    imports: [CommonConsumptionModule],
	    
	    ...
    })

  
    export class TestAppModule { }

Alternatively, you can create a separate NgModule that imports and then re-exports all of the Angular components that you will use in your application. By exporting them again, other modules can simply include your CustomSunbirdComponentsModule wherever components are needed, and automatically get all of the exported modules. A good place for importing/exporting the application-wide modules is the SharedModule.

    import { CardsModule } from '@project-sunbird/common-consumption/card';

    import { PopoverModule } from '@project-sunbird/common-consumption/popover';


    @NgModule({
    
    ...
    
    imports: [CardsModule, PopoverModule],
    
    exports: [CardsModule, PopoverModule],
    
    ...
    
    })


    export class MyOwnCustomSunbirdComponentsModule { }
